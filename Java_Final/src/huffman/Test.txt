Chapter One 



A SQUAT grey building of only thirty-four stories. Over the main en- 
trance the words, CENTRAL LONDON HATCHERY AND CONDITIONING 
CENTRE, and, in a shield, the World State's motto, COMMUNITY, IDEN- 
TITY, STABILITY. 

The enormous room on the ground floor faced towards the north. Cold 
for all the summer beyond the panes, for all the tropical heat of the 
room itself, a harsh thin light glared through the windows, hungrily 
seeking some draped lay figure, some pallid shape of academic goose- 
flesh, but finding only the glass and nickel and bleakly shining porce- 
lain of a laboratory. Wintriness responded to wintriness. The overalls of 
the workers were white, their hands gloved with a pale corpse- 
coloured rubber. The light was frozen, dead, a ghost. Only from the 
yellow barrels of the microscopes did it borrow a certain rich and living 
substance, lying along the polished tubes like butter, streak after 
luscious streak in long recession down the work tables. 

"And this," said the Director opening the door, "is the Fertilizing 
Room." 

Bent over their instruments, three hundred Fertilizers were plunged, as 
the Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning entered the room, in the 



scarcely breathing silence, the absent-minded, soliloquizing hum or 
whistle, of absorbed concentration. A troop of newly arrived students, 
very young, pink and callow, followed nervously, rather abjectly, at the 
Director's heels. Each of them carried a notebook, in which, whenever 
the great man spoke, he desperately scribbled. Straight from the 
horse's mouth. It was a rare privilege. The D. H. C. for Central London 
always made a point of personally conducting his new students round 
the various departments. 

"Just to give you a general idea," he would explain to them. For of 
course some sort of general idea they must have, if they were to do 
their work intelligently-though as little of one, if they were to be good 
and happy members of society, as possible. For particulars, as every 
one knows, make for virtue and happiness; generalities are intellectu- 
ally necessary evils. Not philosophers but fret-sawyers and stamp col- 
lectors compose the backbone of society. 

"To-morrow," he would add, smiling at them with a slightly menacing 
geniality, "you'll be settling down to serious work. You won't have time 
for generalities. Meanwhile ..." 

Meanwhile, it was a privilege. Straight from the horse's mouth into the 
notebook. The boys scribbled like mad. 

Tall and rather thin but upright, the Director advanced into the room. 
He had a long chin and big rather prominent teeth, just covered, when 
he was not talking, by his full, floridly curved lips. Old, young? Thirty? 
Fifty? Fifty-five? It was hard to say. And anyhow the question didn't 
arise; in this year of stability, A. F. 632, it didn't occur to you to ask it. 

"I shall begin at the beginning," said the D.H.C. and the more zealous 
students recorded his intention in their notebooks: Begin at the begin- 
ning. "These," he waved his hand, "are the incubators." And opening 
an insulated door he showed them racks upon racks of numbered test- 
tubes. "The week's supply of ova. Kept," he explained, "at blood heat; 
whereas the male gametes," and here he opened another door, "they 
have to be kept at thirty-five instead of thirty-seven. Full blood heat 
sterilizes." Rams wrapped in theremogene beget no lambs. 

Still leaning against the incubators he gave them, while the pencils 
scurried illegibly across the pages, a brief description of the modern 



fertilizing process; spoke first, of course, of its surgical introduc- 
tion-"the operation undergone voluntarily for the good of Society, not 
to mention the fact that it carries a bonus amounting to six months' 
salary"; continued with some account of the technique for preserving 
the excised ovary alive and actively developing; passed on to a consid- 
eration of optimum temperature, salinity, viscosity; referred to the liq- 
uor in which the detached and ripened eggs were kept; and, leading 
his charges to the work tables, actually showed them how this liquor 
was drawn off from the test-tubes; how it was let out drop by drop 
onto the specially warmed slides of the microscopes; how the eggs 
which it contained were inspected for abnormalities, counted and 
transferred to a porous receptacle; how (and he now took them to 
watch the operation) this receptacle was immersed in a warm bouillon 
containing free-swimming spermatozoa-at a minimum concentration 
of one hundred thousand per cubic centimetre, he insisted; and how, 
after ten minutes, the container was lifted out of the liquor and its 
contents re-examined; how, if any of the eggs remained unfertilized, it 
was again immersed, and, if necessary, yet again; how the fertilized 
ova went back to the incubators; where the Alphas and Betas re- 
mained until definitely bottled; while the Gammas, Deltas and Epsilons 
were brought out again, after only thirty-six hours, to undergo Bo- 
kanovsky's Process. 

"Bokanovsky's Process," repeated the Director, and the students un- 
derlined the words in their little notebooks. 

One egg, one embryo, one adult-normality. But a bokanovskified egg 
will bud, will proliferate, will divide. From eight to ninety-six buds, and 
every bud will grow into a perfectly formed embryo, and every embryo 
into a full-sized adult. Making ninety-six human beings grow where 
only one grew before. Progress. 

"Essentially," the D.H.C. concluded, "bokanovskification consists of a 
series of arrests of development. We check the normal growth and, 
paradoxically enough, the egg responds by budding." 

Responds by budding. The pencils were busy. 

He pointed. On a very slowly moving band a rack-full of test-tubes was 
entering a large metal box, another, rack-full was emerging. Machinery 
faintly purred. It took eight minutes for the tubes to go through, he 



told them. Eight minutes of hard X-rays being about as much as an 
egg can stand. A few died; of the rest, the least susceptible divided 
into two; most put out four buds; some eight; all were returned to the 
incubators, where the buds began to develop; then, after two days, 
were suddenly chilled, chilled and checked. Two, four, eight, the buds 
in their turn budded; and having budded were dosed almost to death 
with alcohol; consequently burgeoned again and having budded-bud 
out of bud out of bud-were thereafter-further arrest being generally 
fatal-left to develop in peace. By which time the original egg was in a 
fair way to becoming anything from eight to ninety-six embryos- a 
prodigious improvement, you will agree, on nature. Identical twins-but 
not in piddling twos and threes as in the old viviparous days, when an 
egg would sometimes accidentally divide; actually by dozens, by 
scores at a time. 

"Scores," the Director repeated and flung out his arms, as though he 
were distributing largesse. "Scores." 

But one of the students was fool enough to ask where the advantage 
lay. 

"My good boy!" The Director wheeled sharply round on him. "Can't you 
see? Can't you see?" He raised a hand; his expression was solemn. 
"Bokanovsky's Process is one of the major instruments of social stabil- 
ity!" 

Major instruments of social stability. 

Standard men and women; in uniform batches. The whole of a small 
factory staffed with the products of a single bokanovskified egg. 

"Ninety-six identical twins working ninety-six identical machines!" The 
voice was almost tremulous with enthusiasm. "You really know where 
you are. For the first time in history." He quoted the planetary motto. 
"Community, Identity, Stability." Grand words. "If we could bo- 
kanovskify indefinitely the whole problem would be solved." 

Solved by standard Gammas, unvarying Deltas, uniform Epsilons. Mil- 
lions of identical twins. The principle of mass production at last applied 
to biology. 



"But, alas," the Director shook his head, "we can't bokanovskify indefi- 
nitely." 

Ninety-six seemed to be the limit; seventy-two a good average. From 
the same ovary and with gametes of the same male to manufacture as 
many batches of identical twins as possible-that was the best (sadly a 
second best) that they could do. And even that was difficult. 

"For in nature it takes thirty years for two hundred eggs to reach ma- 
turity. But our business is to stabilize the population at this moment, 
here and now. Dribbling out twins over a quarter of a century-what 
would be the use of that?" 

Obviously, no use at all. But Podsnap's Technique had immensely ac- 
celerated the process of ripening. They could make sure of at least a 
hundred and fifty mature eggs within two years. Fertilize and bo- 
kanovskify-in other words, multiply by seventy-two-and you get an 
average of nearly eleven thousand brothers and sisters in a hundred 
and fifty batches of identical twins, all within two years of the same 
age. 

"And in exceptional cases we can make one ovary yield us over fifteen 
thousand adult individuals." 

Beckoning to a fair-haired, ruddy young man who happened to be 
passing at the moment. "Mr. Foster," he called. The ruddy young man 
approached. "Can you tell us the record for a single ovary, Mr. Foster?" 

"Sixteen thousand and twelve in this Centre," Mr. Foster replied with- 
out hesitation. He spoke very quickly, had a vivacious blue eye, and 
took an evident pleasure in quoting figures. "Sixteen thousand and 
twelve; in one hundred and eighty-nine batches of identicals. But of 
course they've done much better," he rattled on, "in some of the tropi- 
cal Centres. Singapore has often produced over sixteen thousand five 
hundred; and Mombasa has actually touched the seventeen thousand 
mark. But then they have unfair advantages. You should see the way a 
negro ovary responds to pituitary! It's quite astonishing, when you're 
used to working with European material. Still," he added, with a laugh 
(but the light of combat was in his eyes and the lift of his chin was 
challenging), "still, we mean to beat them if we can. I'm working on a 
wonderful Delta-Minus ovary at this moment. Only just eighteen 



months old. Over twelve thousand seven hundred children already, ei- 
ther decanted or in embryo. And still going strong. We'll beat them 
yet." 

"That's the spirit I like!" cried the Director, and clapped Mr. Foster on 
the shoulder. "Come along with us, and give these boys the benefit of 
your expert knowledge." 

Mr. Foster smiled modestly. "With pleasure." They went. 
In the Bottling Room all was harmonious bustle and ordered activity. 
Flaps of fresh sow's peritoneum ready cut to the proper size came 
shooting up in little lifts from the Organ Store in the sub-basement. 
Whizz and then, click! the lift-hatches hew open; the bottle-liner had 
only to reach out a hand, take the flap, insert, smooth-down, and be- 
fore the lined bottle had had time to travel out of reach along the end- 
less band, whizz, click! another flap of peritoneum had shot up from 
the depths, ready to be slipped into yet another bottle, the next of that 
slow interminable procession on the band. 

Next to the Liners stood the Matriculators. The procession advanced; 
one by one the eggs were transferred from their test-tubes to the 
larger containers; deftly the peritoneal lining was slit, the morula 
dropped into place, the saline solution poured in ... and already the 
bottle had passed, and it was the turn of the labellers. Heredity, date 
of fertilization, membership of Bokanovsky Group-details were trans- 
ferred from test-tube to bottle. No longer anonymous, but named, 
identified, the procession marched slowly on; on through an opening in 
the wall, slowly on into the Social Predestination Room. 
"Eighty-eight cubic metres of card-index," said Mr. Foster with relish, 
as they entered. 

"Containing all the relevant information," added the Director. 
"Brought up to date every morning." 
"And co-ordinated every afternoon." 
"On the basis of which they make their calculations." 
"So many individuals, of such and such quality," said Mr. Foster. 
"Distributed in such and such quantities." 
"The optimum Decanting Rate at any given moment." 
"Unforeseen wastages promptly made good." 

"Promptly," repeated Mr. Foster. "If you knew the amount of overtime I 
had to put in after the last Japanese earthquake!" He laughed good- 
humouredly and shook his head. 

"The Predestinators send in their figures to the Fertilizers." 
"Who give them the embryos they ask for." 



"And the bottles come in here to be predestined in detail." 
"After which they are sent down to the Embryo Store." 
"Where we now proceed ourselves." 

And opening a door Mr. Foster led the way down a staircase into the 
basement. 

The temperature was still tropical. They descended into a thickening 
twilight. Two doors and a passage with a double turn insured the cellar 
against any possible infiltration of the day. 

"Embryos are like photograph film," said Mr. Foster waggishly, as he 
pushed open the second door. "They can only stand red light." 
And in effect the sultry darkness into which the students now followed 
him was visible and crimson, like the darkness of closed eyes on a 
summer's afternoon. The bulging flanks of row on receding row and 
tier above tier of bottles glinted with innumerable rubies, and among 
the rubies moved the dim red spectres of men and women with purple 
eyes and all the symptoms of lupus. The hum and rattle of machinery 
faintly stirred the air. 

"Give them a few figures, Mr. Foster," said the Director, who was tired 
of talking. 

Mr. Foster was only too happy to give them a few figures. 
Two hundred and twenty metres long, two hundred wide, ten high. He 
pointed upwards. Like chickens drinking, the students lifted their eyes 
towards the distant ceiling. 

Three tiers of racks: ground floor level, first gallery, second gallery. 
The spidery steel-work of gallery above gallery faded away in all direc- 
tions into the dark. Near them three red ghosts were busily unloading 
demijohns from a moving staircase. 
The escalator from the Social Predestination Room. 
Each bottle could be placed on one of fifteen racks, each rack, though 
you couldn't see it, was a conveyor traveling at the rate of thirty-three 
and a third centimetres an hour. Two hundred and sixty-seven days at 
eight metres a day. Two thousand one hundred and thirty-six metres in 
all. One circuit of the cellar at ground level, one on the first gallery, 
half on the second, and on the two hundred and sixty-seventh morn- 
ing, daylight in the Decanting Room. Independent existence-so called. 
"But in the interval," Mr. Foster concluded, "we've managed to do a lot 
to them. Oh, a very great deal." His laugh was knowing and trium- 
phant. 

"That's the spirit I like," said the Director once more. "Let's walk 
around. You tell them everything, Mr. Foster."
